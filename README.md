 PS :I FUSIONED THE REPO FROM SCHALK AND MY OWN, I PULLED AND DOWNLOADED SCHALKS REPO, AND I MISTAKENLY DID ALL MY CHANGES THERE. IM GOING TO UPLOAD THAT TOO LATER, JUST IN CASE. THE REPO I MADE CHANGES ON WAS THE ONE UPLOADED AFTER THE SECOND PART OF SATURDAY WORKSHOP, I TRIED TO IMPLEMENT THE REST OF THE WORKSHOP WHILST WATCHING SCALKS THIRD VIDEO. EVERYTHING WAS WORKING UNTIL EARLIER THIS EVENING. APOLOGIES BUT MY WHOLE PROJECT BROKE TODAY. IM NOT SURE AS TO HOW TO FIX IT, ALSO I WELL RAN OUTTA TIME
